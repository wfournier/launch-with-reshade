# launch-with-reshade
Simple Powershell script that uses crosire's ReShade DLL injector and launches a game at the same time.
I made this script because I was having problem installing ReShade on a game using Unreal Mod Unlocker since both use the dxgi.dll file.
This method allows ReShade to be injected as the game launches instead of modifying the game's files.
